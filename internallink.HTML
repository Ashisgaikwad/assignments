<a  name="Introduction"> Introduction </a>
<p> In a world of data space where organizations deal with petabytes and exabytes of data, the era of Big Data emerged, and the essence of its storage also grew. It was a great challenge and concern for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus shifted to the processing of data. Data Science plays a big role here.All those fancy Sci-fi movies you love to watch around can be turned into reality by Data Science.Nowadays its growth has been increased in multiple ways and thus one should be ready for our future by learning what it is and how can we add value to it.Data Science is a combination of multiple disciplines that uses statistics, data analysis, and machine learning to analyze data and to extract knowledge and insights from it.Data science is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing data to extract insights and knowledge. It involves using various techniques, tools, and algorithms to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in data, and to make informed decisions.
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines aspects of computer science, statistics, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge. It involves a range of activities, including data wrangling, data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
Data scientists use a variety of tools and technologies, including programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. They also use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to analyze and interpret data. </p>

<a name="Lifecycle">The Data science Lifecycle </a>
<p> Data Science Lifecycle revolves around the use of machine learning and different analytical strategies to produce insights and predictions from information in order to acquire a commercial enterprise objective. The complete method includes a number of steps like data cleaning, preparation, modelling, model evaluation, etc. It is a lengthy procedure and may additionally take quite a few months to complete. So, it is very essential to have a generic structure to observe for each and every hassle at hand. A data science lifecycle is defined as the iterative set of data science steps required to deliver a project or analysis. There are no one-size-fits that define data science projects. Hence you need to determine the one that best fits your business requirements. Each step in the lifecycle should be performed carefully. Any improper execution will affect the following step, ultimately impacting the entire process. </p>

<a name="Data Scientist">What is Data Scientist </a>
<p> A data scientist is an analytics professional who is responsible for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data to help drive decision-making in an organization. The data scientist role combines elements of several traditional and technical jobs, including mathematician, scientist, statistician and computer programmer. 
Data scientists use data science to glean insights from untold amounts of data, both structured and unstructured. As automation and machine learning become increasingly important components in the IT strategies of large organizations, data analysis grows in stature. The reason? The enormous value practitioners can bring by translating mountains of data into insights that help businesses maximize their potential.Data science continues to evolve as one of the most promising and in-demand career paths for skilled professionals. Today, successful data professionals understand they must advance past the traditional skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills. To uncover useful intelligence for their organizations, data scientists must master the full spectrum of the data science life cycle and possess a level of flexibility and understanding to maximize returns at each phase of the process. </p>
